##### Classification of documents

1. The "Code" file contains a large number of code connections between data institutions and algorithms, which can be basically executed.

2. The "Image" file contains the images needed for the entire project and is not very useful.

3. The "Node" folder is my notes, which records the notes I wrote, including the principle of computer composition, data structure and algorithm, basic knowledge of C language and other markdown type notes, which can be viewed on GitHub.

4. The "References" folder is what I think should be recommended, it will make you more powerful.
